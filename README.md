# Agon Retro Case
Case for the [Agon](https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/agon.html) modern 8-bit computer by [Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com) et al.

I wanted to create a case in the style of the home computers of the 1980s.

The parts can be printed on a normal-sized printer. Some assembly is required.



## Bill of materials

* 1x Cherry G84-4100 mini keyboard. The keyboard is relatively expensive, but it's also available used or as B-stock. Mine cost 19 euros on eBay.
* 1x QIANRENON USB A U-shaped adapter. You can also omit the adapter, but then the keyboard cable will be visible outside the case.
* 14x M3x10 screws.
* 15x M3x12 screws.
* 29x M3 screw nuts.

## Assembly instructions

* Keyboard
  * Disassemble the keyboard. Only the keyboard PCB, the daughterboard beneath it, and the cable are needed. You can shorten the cable. I was lazy and kept it in the case coiled up.
  * Fit the isolator on the daughterboard so that it sits between it and the keyboard PCB.

* Undercarriage
  * Fit the nuts (1x M3 each) into the slots in the rear lower corners. The remaining nuts are inserted in the same manner.
  * Insert screws for the Agon board (4x M3x10).
  * Connect parts (6x M3x12 with nuts).
  * Secure the board (4x M3 nuts).
  * Place the keyboard on the supports so that it rests against the horizontal stops.
  * Guide the keyboard cable beneath the Agon board towards the back.

* Side walls
  * Fit nuts (6x M3 nuts each). Should be a tight fit. I used small pliers with gentle pressure.
  * Attach to the undercarriage (2x M3x10 each).

* Back wall
  * Connect parts (1x M3x12 with nut).
  * Attach to the undercarriage (2x M3x10).
  * Connect keyboard cable, USB adapter, and board.

* Top cover
  * Press the logo into the left cover part.
  * Connect parts (2x M3x12 with nuts).
  * Secure to side walls (2x M3x10) and back wall (2x M3x12).

* Keyboard frame
  * Connect parts (2x M3x12 with nuts).
  * Secure to side walls (2x M3x12 side, 2x M3x10 top).
  * Insert LED cover.

* Blinds
  * Insert both panels into the gap between the keyboard frame and the cover. Depending on your 3D printer's tolerance, the fit between the panel and side wall can be tight. I slightly oversized the panels, so some sanding may be necessary.

## Shortcomings

* Made for the AgonLight2 by Olimex only. I will add base plates for the other variants if there's demand for it.
* The front ports of the board are unusable because of the way it is mounted.
* The attachment of the panels is unsatisfactory. Depending on the print tolerance, they raise in the middle. Hot glue helps, but still, a better mounting is needed.
* No case feet.

## Printing

* PLA 20% grid infill.
* Most parts can be printed without support, but with support, the scew holes look better.
* The blinds should be printed standing upright on the outer side with support.
* I printed the LED cover in transparent PETG.
* Approximate filament amount: 380g
