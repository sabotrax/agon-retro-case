# Agon Retro Case
Case for the [Agon](https://www.thebyteattic.com/p/agon.html) modern 8-bit computer by [Bernardo Kastrup](https://www.bernardokastrup.com) et al.

I wanted to create a case in the style of the home computers of the 1980s.

The parts can be printed on a normal-sized printer. Some assembly is required.

## Bill of materials

* 1x Cherry G84-4100 mini keyboard. The keyboard is relatively expensive, but it's also available used or as B-stock. Mine cost 19 euros on eBay.
* 1x QIANRENON USB A U-shaped adapter. You can also omit the adapter, but then the keyboard cable will be visible outside the case.
* 1x IDC/flat ribbon cable 34 pin extension cable (male/female) 30 cm.
* 1x IDC/flat ribbon cable 10 pin extension cable (male/female) 30 cm.
* 20x M3x10 screws.
* 14x M3x12 screws.
* 3x M3x16 screws.
* 37x M3 screw nuts.

## Assembly instructions

Clean drill holes and check screw passage. Nuts may be loose after insertion. Secure them with glue or screws to prevent them from falling out.

Please also check the [assembly pictures](https://github.com/sabotrax/agon-retro-case/tree/main/pic/assembly).

* Keyboard
  * Disassemble the keyboard. Only the keyboard PCB, the daughterboard beneath it, and the cable are needed. You can shorten the cable. I was lazy and kept it in the case coiled up.
  * Fit the isolator on the daughterboard so that it sits between it and the keyboard PCB.

* Undercarriage
  * Fit the nuts (1x M3 each) into the vertical slots of the back wall supports in the rear corners.
  * Fit the nuts (2x M3 each) into the horizontal slots of the foot supports in the front and rear corners.
  * Fit the nuts (3x M3) into the horizontal slots of the bracket for the expansion ports on the rear left side.
  * Insert screws for the Agon board (4x M3x10) on the rear right side.
  * Connect parts (5x M3x12 with nuts).

* Side walls
  * Fit nuts (6x M3 each). Should be a tight fit. I used small pliers with gentle pressure.
  * Attach to the undercarriage (2x M3x10 each).
 
* Agon board and expansion ports
  * Connect the flat ribbon cables to the expansion ports of the board.
  * Slide the flat ribbon cables into the clip. They only fit in one way.
  * Secure the board (4x M3 nuts). There should be about 1 mm of space between the flat ribbon cables at the board and the rear keyboard rest.
  * Screw (3x M3x16) the clip onto the bracket at the rear left.

* Back wall
  * Fit nuts (1x M3 each) into the horizontal slots on the inner sides.
  * Connect parts (1x M3x12 with nut).
  * Place the keyboard on the supports so that it rests against the horizontal stops.
  * Guide the keyboard cable beneath the Agon board towards the back.
  * Place the back wall against the undercarriage so that the USB connector of the keyboard cable passes through the cutout in the lower right side of the panel.
  * Attach to the undercarriage (2x M3x10 back, 2x M3x10 bottom).
  * Connect keyboard cable, USB adapter, and board.

* Top cover
  * Press the logo into the left cover part.
  * Connect parts (2x M3x12 with nuts).
  * Secure to side walls (2x M3x10) and back wall (2x M3x12).

* Keyboard frame
  * Connect parts (2x M3x12 with nuts).
  * Secure to side walls (2x M3x12 side, 2x M3x10 top).
  * Insert LED cover.

* Blinds
  * Insert both blinds into the gap between the keyboard frame and the top cover. Press the outer part of the blind into the housing first, and then the inner part, aligning the pin with the receptacle on the top cover. Depending on your 3D printer's tolerance, the fit between the blind and side wall can be tight.

* Feet
  * Screw the feet (4x M3x10) into the receptacles on the underside of the case.

## Shortcomings

* Made for the AgonLight2 by Olimex only. I will add base plates for the other variants if there's demand for it.

## Printing

* PLA 20% grid infill.
* Most parts can be printed without support, but with support, the scew holes look better.
* If you print the base plates with supports, make sure to exclude the horizontal slots for the screw nuts, because the support material is difficult to remove from them.
* The blinds should be printed with supports standing upright on the outer side.
* I printed the LED cover in transparent PETG.
* Approximate filament amount: 400g
